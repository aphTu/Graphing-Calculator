# Graphing Calculator 
## Description:
- A graphing calculator similar to Desmos
- built using SFML with the help of C++
- It has a history feature with the last 5 graph the user have chosen to graph
- The history is clickable, meaning clicking on any equation in the history will automatically make the calcualtor graph it
- The user have the ability to either graph in cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates
- Have the ability to move left, right, up, down, and zoom in or out on the graph
- Bugs
  - If program is fullscreen, history will not be wokring properly
- Not Implements:
  - Did not implement the way to see specific grid lines to indicate what number it is on the screen 
<br><br>

## Commands:
- To write a new equation for the calculator to graph use "t"
  - This will bring up a textbox for the user to write in
  - Include either "P" or "R", for polar or rectangular(cartesian) graph respectively, at the front of the graph followed by the equations user wished to graph
  - use "o" to zoom out and "p" to zoom in
  - use the arrow keys to move around
  - use "esc" to exit the program
